# Vector Addition Solver
##Synopsis:
The Vector Addition Solver, built using Notepad++ and the MinGW C++ Compiler, is is a Windows based command line program. The program adds multiple two dimensional vectors together with the user specifying how many vectors to add. This is because the amount of vectors is unknown at compilation. Please note the for the angle of a vector, the polar coordinate system is used.

##Motivation:
The main purpose of this project to practice fundamental object oriented concepts and skills to solve vector problems that take significant amounts of time to solve by hand. Concepts and skills used within this project include: classes, the string class, operator overloading, streams, static variables, and static methods.

##Installation:
To install the Vector Addition Solver please download and run the "Vector_Addition_Solver.exe" file in the releases tab. Please note your anti-virus may need to be disabled in order for the program to function properly.
